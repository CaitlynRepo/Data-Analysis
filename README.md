The Dataset is collected from Flixable - a third-party Netflix search engine, and is available on Kaggle for free. The Dataset has 7789 rows with 11 columns in total. This project aims to use Python to spot trends and answer questions on Netflix Dataset \
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib. 


### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset
**Code:** ['Exploratory Data Analysis on Zomato Dataset'](https://github.com/CaitlynRepo/Python/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20Project%20on%20Zomato%20Dataset.ipynb)    
**Description:** Zomato is one of the largest Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery companies. This project aims to perform EDA on the dataset to answer business questions using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib \
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib. 

### 5. House Price Predictions Using Simple Machine Learning Models
**Code:** ['House Price Predictions Using Machine Learning Models'](https://github.com/CaitlynRepo/Python/blob/main/House%20Price%20Prediction%20Project/House_Price_Prediction_ML_Project.ipynb)  
**Description:** The dataset contains 79 independent variables that can affect a house's selling price. This project targets to build simple Regression models using Decision Tree and Random Forest to predict a house with different features for a new input. \
**Technology:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Decision Tree, Random Forest

### 6. Hedge Fund Management and Stock Analysis
**Code:** ['Hedge Fund Management and Stock Analysis'](https://github.com/CaitlynRepo/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Hedge%20Fund%20Management%20%26%20Stock%20Analysis/Data%20Analysis%20Project%20%20Hedge%20Fund%20Management%20%26%20Stock%20Analysis.ipynb)\
**Description:** Two datasets were used in this project, one was the hedge fund return from EDHEC risk dataset from Jan 1997 to Aug 2020 while the other one includes prices for various stocks from Yahoo Finance between Jan 2000 and Mar 2022. I practiced a variety of finance concepts on the datasets such as calculation of Skewness, Kurtosis, Semideviation and VaR. I also attempted to predict the stock price of Microsoft using ARIMA model.\
**Technology:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Sklearn, ARIMA

### 7. Superstore Tableau Data Visualization
**Viz Snippet:** ![Superstore Overview Dashboard](Viz/Superstore-Overview.png)

**Description:** The superstore dataset is retail transaction data (or point-of-sales). The dataset is used to conduct data visualizations for insights such as total number order, most bought product category and customer loyalty values. All of the analyses and visualization are done in Tableau.
